# Lots of mini-projects

These are just a few exercises from the FREE [Frontend Masters Bootcamp](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/) that use javascript.

No build commands, no dependencies. Just simple js, css and html.

There is also one node.js course. A basic introduction to node servers.

Specifically, these projects are from the 'Calculator Project', 'Using Javascript in Websites' and 'Node' courses.
