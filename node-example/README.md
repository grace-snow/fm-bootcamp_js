# About

This is the **node** part of Frontend Masters' [Intro to Web Dev](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/) course.

I identified a skills gap around node, so did this part of the course. 

## Notes

**See comments** - Notes are inline in the files for this course. 

The course was taught by Brian Holt and I completed it early in April 2020.
